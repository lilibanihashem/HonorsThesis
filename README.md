# HonorsThesis

Welcome to my data science senior thesis! 

This study was motivated by the fact that studies consistently show child care workers to face disproportionate levels of depression. Using data from the National Survey for Early Care and Education, my goal was to apply statistical and machine learning methods including logistic regression, classification trees, and random forest modeling to investigate some of the key causes of depression in child care workers.
